Last time I changed the triangle expanders for consistency throughout the theme. However, changing treeview expanders also changed treeview gradients/progress bars/checkmarks/dots/everything in treeview. Regardless of whether the treeview used expanders or not, it still distorted the look. Now there may be some treeviews that use murrine, and some that use pixmap for the triangle expander. This may cause some treeviews to have murrine +/- expanders. In the newer releases of murrine, it will default to triangles, so in the future, even if I don't change this, it will look more consistent. Try a newer murrine in Ubuntu here: https://launchpad.net/~suraia/+archive/ppa

Original Description
-------------------------------

Something bothering me lately was that many of the newer themes being released seem to be 'locked.' That is to say, they have hard coded colors and elements. I wanted to make a theme that:

1) Was not distracting.
2) Was not boring.
3) Was not completely ugly.
4) Could be used with many Window borders, and any user chosen color.

Having found success in only one of four goals*... It seems accomplished enough for me. VICTORY! (?) So pick any combination of colors, pick a window border, and enjoy.

Any feedback would be great. I have never done anything like this, so there may be a lot of problems with it... Let me know what you think, what you like, what you dislike. Thanks!

- Darin

*Goal 3 met: only slightly ugly.

The following applications are themed so far:

Nautilus & Nautilus Elementary
Thunar
PCManFM
